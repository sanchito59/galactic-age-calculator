# Galactic Age Calculator

## By **Chris Sanchez**

Galactic Age Calculator is an application that will take a user's age in Earth years and convert it into their age in years on the planets within the solar system. This project focuses on implementing Test Driven Development in order to build a web app which uses tests before writing code.

Celestial bodies rotate and revolve around the Sun at different speeds. The time it takes for the Earth to rotate completely around its axis is 24 hours, commonly called a day. On Mercury it takes 58.6 Earth days to make that same rotation around its axis, or approximately 1,407 hours, 30 minutes, and 14 seconds- close to two whole months here on Earth. While it takes Mercury 58.6 Earth Days to complete a single one of its days, Mercurcy revolves around the Sun much faster than the Earth does. It takes the Earth roughly 365.26 days to orbit the Sun whereas Mercury completes its orbit in only 87.89 days. Knowing all of this we can then use a simple formula to calculate how old you would be on another Planet. For example, if you are 56 years old on Earth you would be about 233 years old on Mercury.
